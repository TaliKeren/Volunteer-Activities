# Volunteer-Activities
Getting USDSers involved in volunteer activities.

Here are a list of current ideas for volunteer activities:
1.	1 or 2 large-scale yearly initiatives either partnering with an existing organization or launching an initiative that is entirely USDS’ (think a worthwhile cause in-line with our ethos and culture).

2.	USDS Service day – all current and alumni USDSers, wherever they are will to partake in a giving-back-activity on this day

3.	Smaller quarterly time and money (collect funds for a cause, put together meals for the shelter, or volunteer time)

4.	Grassroots – post ideas on the #volunteering slack channel where small teams can form 
 
Specific examples: 
•	Leveraging our skills to mentor and coach young professionals on job search, career options, mock interviewing and so forth 
•	Purchase birthday packages to financially strapped families 
•	Put together bikes for foster kids 
•	Teach youth life skills 
•	Upwardly Global
•	Children’s hospital 
•	Organizations supporting the communities we serve for example veterans.
